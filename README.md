This is me trying to fix BOT EXPERIMENT Credit: FURIOUSPUPPY. i didnt learn coding, the codes are mostly made by arzon4dt. (github) i just jumbled and tried to fix the code. Hope the bots will be better than the existing ones!

changelogs (not all, just find out the others)
- correct talent progression until level 30 (the older bots seem to learn only 4 talents at level 30? weird. fixed now)
- skill build made into just 1 build
- disabled some characters because they're weak/broken
- fixing some skills (fixed alchemist ulti, omniknight hammer of purity, omniknight guardian angel)
- fixed item builds for bots into more relevant ones, newer items can be bought
  
and more

instructions: this is what i did
1. Download the zip file from github
2. Create a bots folder containing the files from the github
(under the directory \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\scripts\vscripts\ )

in other words, the whole zip file will go into..
...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\scripts\vscripts\bots\

3. Create a lobby with localhost server (you have to be online)
4. On the bot script dropdown select local dev script
5. Select the game mode (support Captain Mode, All Pick, Turbo Mode, Mid Only Same Hero, and 1 VS 1)
NOTE: i only tested this on turbo mode
6. Start the game and enjoy!

you'll know you did it correctly if the bots' names are based from famous esports teams in a
(team).(playername).(sponsor) format.

Note: Recently starting the game using Practice with bot using this script will only select the default bot hero pool and disable the chat to select a hero and lane assignment feature since GetTeamPlayers() function of the API will return only human player as the valid player. This caused the script to unable to assign a selected hero to the bot player id so the default bot hero selection logic will take over this script hero selection logic.
