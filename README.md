This is me trying to fix BOT EXPERIMENT Credit: FURIOUSPUPPY. i didnt learn coding, the codes are mostly made by arzon4dt. (github) i just jumbled and tried to fix the code. Hope the bots will be better than the existing ones!

changelogs (not all, just find out the others)
- correct talent progression until level 30 (the older bots seem to learn only 4 talents at level 30? weird. fixed now)
- skill build made into just 1 build
- disabled some characters because they're weak/broken
- fixing some skills (fixed alchemist ulti, omniknight hammer of purity, omniknight guardian angel)
- fixed item builds for bots into more relevant ones, newer items can be bought
and more
